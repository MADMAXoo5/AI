    <h4>The term <b>artificial intelligence</b> may be used for
     any computer that has characteristics similar to
      the human brain, including the ability to think critically, make decisions,
       and increase productivity. The foundation of AI is human insights that may be determined in such a manner 
       that machines can easily realize the jobs, from the most simple to the most complicated.</h4>

             formerly performed manually, are now performed digitally.
              Currently, tasks or occupations that involve some degree of 
              repetition or the use and interpretation of large amounts of
               data are communicated to and administered by a computer, and 
               in certain cases, the intervention of humans is not required
